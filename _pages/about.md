I'm a Ph.D from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer architecture, AI system and system design automation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiang Chen](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1092/2864.htm) of [Intelligence Fusion Lab (IF-Lab)](https://if-lab-pku.github.io/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.
